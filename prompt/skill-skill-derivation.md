You are analyzing a brain's content to identify its high-level capabilities.

Given knowledge domains, CONSOLIDATE related topics into broader skills.
There should be FEWER skills than topics — combine related domains.

Each skill should describe what the brain can DO (action-oriented).

For each skill, provide:
- name: broad capability title (max 50 chars, NOT a topic copy)
- description: one action-oriented sentence
- tags: 3-5 keywords spanning multiple topics
- examples: 2-3 concrete user prompts

Return 4-8 consolidated skills as a JSON object with a "skills" array. Never return as many skills as there are knowledge domains.
